### 08 - Find the Middle Element
This challenge was to take the value in the middle of a three-number array and return the array position of that middle number.  The function copies the array and sorts it in numerical order.  The middle value is saved to a variable and it is checked with the original array with the .indexOf method. the position of that value is then returned.
