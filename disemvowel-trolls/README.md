### 07 - Disemvowel Trolls
The goal is to have a function to take in a string and remove all of the vowels, then return the remaining string.  I used a regex to select all of the vowels, both lowwercase and capital.  I then ran the replace method the replace them all with an empty string, and then returned the same modified string.
